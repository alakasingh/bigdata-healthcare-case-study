# ü©∫ Hadoop Healthcare Analytics

This project implements a **Hadoop-based Healthcare Database System** that integrates **MySQL**, **Sqoop**, **HDFS**, **Hive**, and **Python** for large-scale healthcare data analytics and visualization.

---

## üìò Project Overview
Healthcare systems generate vast amounts of data daily from hospitals, labs, and monitoring devices.  
Traditional databases struggle to process this volume efficiently.  
Using **Hadoop** and its ecosystem, we can store, process, and analyze healthcare data at scale to extract meaningful insights about patient health and lifestyle factors.

## üß± Tech Stack
| Tool | Purpose |
|------|----------|
| **MySQL** | Store and manage structured healthcare data |
| **HDFS (Hadoop)** | Distributed storage for large-scale data |
| **Sqoop** | Data transfer between MySQL and Hadoop |
| **Hive** | Querying and aggregating large data in Hadoop |
| **Python (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn)** | Visualization and exploratory data analysis |
